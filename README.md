# avxtest
Simple code to test AVX type of development

## Rationale
This simple codebase is used as a scratchpad to play around with *AVX* (and possibly *AVX2*).
It does consist of a simple test and a performance micro benchmark (a function call really...).

## How to build
Simply run:
> make
or
> make release
to compile and then
> ./avxtest
to run the test and performance simple micro benchmark.
